# DevOps End to End Lab with Azure and Node.js

- My rough notes [ben-lab-notes.md](ben-lab-notes.md)
- [App snippets](app-snippets.md) for people copy & paste in, over their generated app (With spelling mistake!)
- [Sample working app source](src) - for people that get stuck or starting later parts without needing to all of part 1
- [Azure templates](azure-templates) - working ARM template + param file for people to copy & paste or download
