# Working Repo for DevOps labs 

Current rough skeleton layout, *not fixed, please change and move stuff!*


## Areas
### "Complete" Node DevOps Lab
(Might need to think about the parts and where we split it + how we structure it, maybe one readme.md which is the table of contents and intro and then .md files for each part. Maybe sub-folders?)

Initial idea...
 - Part 1 - Creating app & CI
 - Part 2 - Starting CD - IaC & ARM
 - Part 3 - Rest of CD (release) & App Insights
